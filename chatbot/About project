This project is about a simple chatbot . We can talk casually like name , age , or any other questions and it will replay. 
I have also added wikipedia library so that we can ask about any one or anything. It will get data from wikipedia and will give
an overview about that persion (ex: Who is Obama ).
Unlike questions we can ask for what is the time, date ,day and other questions we daily ask to someone.
I have uploaded two projects , one with Tkider and other without Tkinder . The Tkinder is used to get a good UI for the user
so that one without any programming knowledge can also use the chatbot. Also i have separately save all the lists needed for sorting the
sentence using NLP tools. It is named as listing.py which is also uploaded along with the code
